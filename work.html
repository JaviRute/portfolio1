                <p class="job">2017 – 2022 MFL Teacher (Spanish and French)</p>
                <p>During this time, I developed skills such as preparation of teaching materials, communication with parents and students, verbal and presentation skills, prioritising tasks to deal with workload, study techniques... and a lot of patience!</p> 
                <p>From a more technical perspective, I enhanced my knowledge of MS Office, and learnt to teach online (MS Teams, Google Classroom, Frog).</p>
                <p>But the key skill that I developed, and which I consider to be my strongest asset, is my enthusiasm to continue working in whichever project I am concentrating on, to the point that I can’t put my mind out of it until it is complete.</p>
                <p>Some of the schools I have worked for include Hendon School (2020 to 2022), Enfield County School for Girls (2019) and Queen Elizabeth’s Girls’ School (2017 to 2019), apart from having worked for several teaching agencies.</p>

                <p class="job">2013 – 2017 Pub Shift Leader</p>
                <p>At The Coronet (JD Wetherspoon) I was in charge of the bar and the cellar at a very busy and popular pub with a large volume of sales. </p> 
                <p>I developed skills such as business management, leadership (being in charge of 15+ employees at times), cash management, stock management, customer service, working under pressure, team work, establishing relationships with customers, staff and suppliers (especially microbreweries), training  and coaching staff, handling deliveries, etc</p>
                <p>I also barred lots of customers.</p>
